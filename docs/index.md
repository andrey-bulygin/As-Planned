# App Mission

- Get a simple yet descriptive picture of your day in just several taps and swipes.
- Learn if you spend enough time on important things.
- Develop a planning habit with ease.

# How it works

Simply put, you make plans, and later optionally correct those with facts.

- _plan_ &mdash; any future time input starting the next hour from now.
- _fact_ &mdash; any past time and/or the current hour input.
- for any bit of time _plan_ is counted as _fact_ unless explicit _fact_ is tracked.

# Use Gestures

- Timeline: tap to select an hour (for a further breakdown on the hour dial) OR swipe horizontally to quickly mark full hour plans/facts.
- Hour dial: swipe clock-wise to mark an interval OR tap to mark a separate 5-minute slice.
- Use the hour dial center tap to mark/overwrite a whole hour.
- Slide the header date left/right to quickly switch between neighboring days.
