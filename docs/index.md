# App Mission

- Get a simple yet descriptive picture of your day in just several taps and swipes.
- Learn if you spend enough time on important things.
- Develop a planning habit with ease.

# How it works

Simply put, you make plans, and later optionally correct those with facts.

- _plan_ &mdash; any future time input starting the next hour from now.
- _fact_ &mdash; any past time and/or the current hour input.
- for any bit of time _plan_ is counted as _fact_ unless explicit _fact_ is tracked.

To add plans / facts you use:

1. The 24-hour timeline: for full hours.
1. The selected hour dial: for minute time spans with up to 5 minute granularity.

Once you have started adding daily plans / facts, you can assess your results using:

1. The day timeline and / or the selected hour dial.
1. Quick day statistics by the &Sigma; sign next to the activity pencils.
1. Day/Week/Month statistics by the chart sign of the main bottom menu.

# Use Gestures

- Timeline: tap to select an hour (for a further breakdown on the hour dial) OR swipe horizontally to quickly mark full hour plans/facts.
- Hour dial: swipe clock-wise to mark an interval OR tap to mark a separate 5-minute slice.
- Use the hour dial center tap to mark/overwrite a whole hour.
- Slide the header date left/right to quickly switch between neighboring days.

# More Advice

- There are couple more activities to turn on if needed. Please, find those at `Settings > Activities`.
- You might want to use the `Settings > Notifications > Plan Reminder` to set up a daily notification reminding you to make next day plans.
